This is a 2048 game in Python where the player slides tiles to combine numbers and add the tiles all the way to 2048. This game uses the Flask framework, and utilizes the command ***flask --app run*** to run the application. 

The challenge in making this game for a web page was to create a user-friendly interface that could be easily navigated and interacted with. Though the numbers can be moved and added to eachother, I didn't get to the point to make it look good when it moves rather than the quick add it currently has. To accomplish this, I used the Flask framework to handle the user inputs, update the game, and update the grid in the HTML table. 

Overall, the project showcases the power of combining Flask, html, js, and css to create the web-based game. All the js and css my code was put into the html code because I'm careless with the webpage stuff. The point of this project was just to see if I could put python code to run on a webpage and this is the solution I found.
